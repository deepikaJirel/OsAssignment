3. Command(s): `cat ~/.profile`
4. PATH = `source ~/.profile`
   - Difference: `The difference is in the PATH in addition of $HOME/bin`
   `/home/ubuntu/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin`
   `/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin`
